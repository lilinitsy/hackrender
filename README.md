# hackrender
Hackrender in its current form is a conglomeration of animation methods that will eventually be merged to be used a 3D Nethack game.

## Features
- Particle Engine

- Newtonian Mechanics

- Cloth Simulation, avoids intersections / self-collisions and twisting on itself.

- Crowd Simulation with agents that motion plan towards a goal in a randomized environment.

### Images
